## Features
- Dual Joystick Control – Allows users to control robot movement using an intuitive on-screen joystick.
- Motor Speed Sliders – Adjusts left and right motor speeds dynamically.
- ESP32 Communication – Sends movement commands via Wi-Fi to an ESP32-based robotic system.
- Real-Time Feedback – Displays joystick and slider values for precise control.
- Modern UI/UX – A minimalist, dark-themed interface for ease of use.

## Technologies Used
|Technology|	Purpose|
|----------|--------|
|Flutter|	UI framework for cross-platform development|
|Dart|	Programming language used in Flutter|
|flutter_joystick|	Joystick package for motion control|
|ESP32|	Microcontroller for hardware communication|
|HTTPS/Wi-Fi|	Wireless communication protocol|


## Installation & Setup
# Prerequisites
Install Flutter SDK 

Install Dart 

Install Git 

 # Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/SolomonNwachukwu/tracer_app_mvp.git
cd tracer_app_mvp
# Install Dependencies

flutter pub get
# Run the App
flutter run
(Ensure your device/emulator is connected and running.)

## How It Works
- Open the app and connect it to the ESP32-based robotic system.
- Use the joystick for directional control of the robot.
- Adjust the left and right motor speeds using the provided sliders.
- The app sends commands over Wi-Fi (via MQTT or HTTP requests).
- The robot receives and executes movement commands accordingly.

## To-Do / Future Improvements
- Add Bluetooth Support for offline communication.
- Implement Gesture Controls for smoother interaction.
- Enhance Real-Time Feedback with sensor data visualization.
- Optimize UI/UX for a more immersive user experience.
