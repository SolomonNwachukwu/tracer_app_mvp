###Tracer App MVP
🚀 Tracer App MVP is a Flutter-based control interface for remotely operating robotic systems, integrating joystick-based motion control, real-time ESP32 communication, and motor speed adjustments via sliders.




🛠 Features
✅ Dual Joystick Control – Allows users to control robot movement using an intuitive on-screen joystick.
✅ Motor Speed Sliders – Adjusts left and right motor speeds dynamically.
✅ ESP32 Communication – Sends movement commands via Wi-Fi to an ESP32-based robotic system.
✅ Real-Time Feedback – Displays joystick and slider values for precise control.
✅ Modern UI/UX – A minimalist, dark-themed interface for ease of use.

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ Open the app and connect it to the ESP32-based robotic system.
2️⃣ Use the joystick for directional control of the robot.
3️⃣ Adjust the left and right motor speeds using the provided sliders.
4️⃣ The app sends commands over Wi-Fi (via MQTT or HTTP requests).
5️⃣ The robot receives and executes movement commands accordingly.

📌 To-Do / Future Improvements
🔹 Add Bluetooth Support for offline communication.
🔹 Implement Gesture Controls for smoother interaction.
🔹 Enhance Real-Time Feedback with sensor data visualization.
🔹 Optimize UI/UX for a more immersive user experience.
